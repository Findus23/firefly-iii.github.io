Many [withdrawals]({{ 'guide-categories.html' | absolute_url }}) come back every month. Firefly III supports the creation of so-called "Bills" which can help you keep track of which bills to expect.

Bills are triggered when you create an expense with certain words in the description, with an amount in a pre-set range or going to a specific [expense account]({{ 'guide-categories.html' | absolute_url }}). When triggered, the transaction and the bill are connected and the bill will be marked as "paid". At least, for this period.

Bills can be set to be expected every week, month or year.
