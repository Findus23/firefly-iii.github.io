### So what is this thing really?

Firefly III is a web application written in PHP 7.0 with a database behind it that can be the tool you use to manage your personal finances. For more information, please read the [full description](/description/).

### How can I use it?

You must install it yourself on webhosting of your choice, or on a webserver you have access to. The [installation guide](/installation-guide/) can help you.

### What if that is too complex for me?

Sorry, can't help you there.

### I have a problem installing or using it!

[Open an issue](https://github.com/JC5/firefly-iii/issues/new) or send [me a message](mailto:thegrumpydictator@gmail.com).

### The installation is difficult

I know, and I'm sorry. I never intended this tool to be actually used by other people. I put it on Github because it was free. 

### Firefly III is complicated

Same answer, I'm afraid. Let me know what I can do to help!
