### So what is this thing really?

Firefly III is a web application written in PHP 7.0 with a database behind it that can be the tool you use to manage your personal finances. For more information, please read the [full description](/description/).

### How can I use it?

You must install it yourself on webhosting of your choice, or on a webserver you have access to. The [installation guide](/installation-guide/) can help you.

### Can I try it first?

[Yes, you can!](https://firefly-iii.nder.be/)

### I have found a security related issue

Please [contact me asap](/reporting-bugs-and-security-issues/).

### Can I use it on PHP 5.x?

No. Most code has been written specifically for PHP 7.0 and higher.

### How do I use the "balancing act"-tag?

Please read [the page about tags](/tags/)

### I have a problem installing or using it!

[Open an issue](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/new) or send [me a message](mailto:thegrumpydictator@gmail.com).

### I get weird Javascript errors

If you have installed the `javascript-common` package, please remove it. It overrides your Apache configuration and breaks Firefly III.
