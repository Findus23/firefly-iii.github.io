title: The difference between categories and budgets
show: yes

If you can save money every month on a certain subject, it's a [budget]({{ 'guide-budgets.html' | absolute_url }}). Groceries are budget. Bills are a budget. If you travel by train occasionally, it's not a budget.

First and foremost: a [category]({{ 'guide-categories.html' | absolute_url }}) is "incidental". You don't buy new furniture every month but you might want to keep track of such expenses. Or you don't care about costs for public traffic (budget-wise) but a category would be nice.

The rule of thumb is: would you make a real life envelope for it? If yes: budget. If no: category.

Categories can be used in [deposits]({{ 'guide-transactions.html' | absolute_url }}) (earning money). Budgets cannot.
