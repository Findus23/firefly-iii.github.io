## Try Firefly III

There is a [demo site](https://geld.nder.be/) available where you can try Firefly III.

### Information

If you want to use the [demo site](https://geld.nder.be/) either temporarily or permanently, please remember the following:

First, although almost all entries are encrypted (in case of a database breach), I can read them if I want to. I have very little interest in your finances, but remember that Firefly III is not built to protect your information from the person running it. After all, you're supposed to run _your own_ copy. Don't look at me when you use mine. In theory, I can see everything.

If you install Firefly III on your own site, I cannot see anything of course.

Amounts are not encrypted. In the unlikely case of a database breach, entries may be encrypted but the size of the amounts and the direction in which your money flows can be deduced.

Database backups are created regularly (off-site). If you use the demo site for more than a few hours, your data will end up in a (PGP encrypted) backup for up to 30 days.

### Disclaimer

There are some disclaimers for this demo site.

* Everything is offered as is. If your data is broken or gone, sorry.
* Although the site and the web server itself are pretty secure, remember that I have access to your data.

Still there are also advantages to the demo site:

* Your password is hashed very securely.
* It runs on a secure https connection.
* It's also used by me so it's almost always up.

# Finally

Some other things you must remember:

* The demo site has a trial period, which is one month. After one month, you will no longer be able to login.
* If your email address is invalid, your account is automatically blocked.
* Temporary email addresses and throw-away addresses are automatically blocked.
