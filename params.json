It can help you keep track of expenses, income, budgets and everything in between. It even supports credit cards, shared \r\nhousehold accounts and savings accounts! It's pretty fancy. You should use it to save and organise money.\r\n \r\nPersonal financial management is pretty difficult, and everybody has their own approach to it. Some people\r\nmake budgets, other people limit their cashflow by throwing away their credit cards, others try to increase\r\ntheir current cashflow. There are tons of ways to save and earn money.\r\n\r\nFirefly works on the principle that if you know where you're money is going, you can stop it from going there.\r\n\r\nTo get to know Firefly, and to see if it fits you, check out these resources:\r\n\r\n- The screenshots below on this very page.\r\n- The featurelist below, also on this very page.\r\n- The [full description](https://github.com/JC5/firefly-iii/wiki/full-description), which will tell you how Firefly works,\r\nand the philosophy behind it.\r\n\r\n#### A quick technical overview\r\n\r\nFirefly is a system you'll have install yourself on webhosting of your choosing.
