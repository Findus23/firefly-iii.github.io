This page tells you what to do in two scenarios:

1. If you find a security related issue 
2. If your data import fails, if Firefly crashes or something else goes horribly wrong, the log files usually will tell you what happened. You can use these log files in issues, or in a email message to me. Problem is: the log files often contain sensitive information.


## Report security related issues.

Send me a message [by mail](mailto:thegrumpydictator@gmail.com). Do not open an issue at Github yet. I will push a fix and update Firefly the affected versions. Use [my public key](http://pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&search=0xC16961E655E74B5E) to encrypt your message.
 
## Sending (sensitive) log files

If you want, you can send me the log files directly [by mail](mailto:thegrumpydictator@gmail.com). I promise to keep them safe, and destroy them when I no longer need them. Whether or not you trust me to handle them with care, is up to you.

You can also use PGP to encrypt data. [This is my public key](http://pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&search=0xC16961E655E74B5E). It is the same key as I use to [sign commits](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/commit/186b704509deaa17257ddd6956f579db2bb37d67). Send your data encrypted with that key, and I am the only one who will be able to read it.
