Although currently in beta, Firefly III supports [Sandstorm.io](https://sandstorm.io/).

You can try Firefly III in Sandstorm by going to your Firefly III directory and running `vagrant-spk dev`.

This should add the app to your Sandstorm instance in "dev"-mode. Any feedback you may have is welcome!
