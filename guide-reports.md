Firefly can generate fancy reports that will help you get a visual impression on how your finances are doing.

Each report can be generated for a custom period _and_ for a specific selection of accounts, budgets and/or categories (whatever applies).

Click on the screenshots for a better view.

The following four reports are currently supported:

## Default financial report

This report gives you a general overview of your accounts including all budgets, categories and bills.

## Transaction history overview (audit)

This report gives you a per-account overview of your expenses. As you can see in the screenshot, you see all supported fields if you want to.

## Budget report

This report shows you a detailed overview for the selected budgets _and_ the selected account, allowing you to see how well you're doing, budget-wise.

Part of this information is also available on the default budget pages and your front page.

## Category report

This report is the same as the budget report but focusses on your categories. It can also include income, which can be very useful.
