## The license
Firefly III comes [with this license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/master/LICENSE).

## Security

You should always run Firefly III on a site with TLS enabled (`https://`). Please note that although some parts of the
database are encrypted (transaction descriptions, names, etc.) some parts are **not** (amounts, dates, some descriptions, etc). If you need
more security, you must enable transparent database encryption or a comparable technology. Please remember that this
is open source software under active development, and it is in no way guaranteed to be safe or secure.

## Translations

Firefly III is currently available in English, Dutch, and some other languages. Support for even more languages is being worked on. I could use
your help. Checkout [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/firefly-iii) for more information.
